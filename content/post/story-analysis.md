# Warnings

* This stuff always hurts my head, but I've got the hang of it easy,
  no sweat, straight away!

* Blogs are recorded chaos. Fight the chaos with reviews, critique and comments. :-)

* For those of you who care to comment, please feel free to add your
  ideas. Please keep it peaceful, honest, true, lovely and kind. Any
  comments (as usual/expected) that don't pass my filter will get
  deleted. If you didn't know that, well, dudes, seriously, it's
  obvious that troll-like comments deserve to be deleted.

* I will attempt to love you though, though when I'm not 100% succesful,
  please forgive me.

* Your rubbish comments just sucked though. :-)

* Everything here is true, but not everything is right. This statement
  is both true and false, and may or may not be precise and/or accurate.

* Intentionally ambiguous so I can attempt to persuade you I meant the
  other lie (err, truth).

# Facts

## Introduction

During the first week or so of March 2016 I got interested in
[Narrative Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_inquiry);
that is, how to dig into narratives or story; books, movies, comics,
myth, novels, books, comedy (all narrative based creative works
essentially, which is almost everything isn't it).

I read stuff, watched videos, watched some films, and applied some
things I already knew from somewhere else.

Here's a summary of what I learned. To me it makes a lot of sense,
though as I'm learning I well aware I could be completely missing the
point.

## How To Dump Twitter

* Find it in `Settings -> Your Twitter Data` (you'll need password).

* *THIS IS AWESOME!*
* To include in your blog;
  1. Copy verbatim to your static data.
  2. Edit for style
  3. Make a link from blog.
  4. ...
  5. Profit!
