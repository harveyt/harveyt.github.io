Purpose Of This Tutorial 
========================

* A basic blog setup:
  * Post first blog entry.
  * Themes, layout and prettiness comes later.
* Close to free as possible:
  * Free as in beer (almost no money).
  * Free as in speech (open source).
* Want lots of control, not afriad of command line tools.
  * Change Management using [git].
  * Blog and web pages are served as static html.
  * Preview and author locally using text files.
  * Publishing is a simple shell command.

Tools Required
==============

This tutorial assumes usage and familiarity with the following tools:

* **[bash]** - Unix shell command line terminal:
  * This tutorial uses Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10, but any Unix-like system will be very similar.
  * Alternatives include:
	* Linux, which should have [bash] installed.
	* Windows, where you might want to install [Cygwin], [MinGW] or [MinGW-w64].
* **Text editor** - needed to configure and write blogs:
  * I personally use [Emacs].
	* Download and install [markdown-mode] and [yaml-mode].
  * Alternatives include [Vim], and so many others.
	* Hopefully your editor of choice supports [Markdown] and [YAML].
* **[git]** - for source code control.
  * There are alternatives like Mercurial or Subversion, but [Git] makes the most sense here.
* **[GitHub]** - providies hosting of the web page and git repository.
  * There are alternatives like BitBucket, Gitorious, Heroku, etc.

New Tools Used
==============

### Jekyll and Octopress 3

This tutorial uses [git] and [GitHub] for source code control, and if you
check out [GitHub Pages] you'll see that they "support Jekyll, a
simple, blog-aware static site generator." (from [Using Jekyll with Pages]).

[Jekyll] allows you write your blog and website in [Markdown] (or
other similar markup languages) in text files. With a simple build
command [Jekyll] converts these into static html pages.

There are other alternatives such as Hyde or WordPress, use google if
you want to find out more.

Since this tutorial is using [git] to store the blog and website, it
leads to a simple work flow for creating a blog post:

* Create a new post text file.
* Write [Markdown] in that text file with our editor.
* Preview the resulting site locally using [Jekyll].
* Add and commit this file locally using [git].
* Publish the web site by pushing to [GitHub].
* [GitHub] will then automatically regenerate the website using [Jekyll] on it's servers.

[Jekyll] itself is written in [Ruby] and is a fairly complex and low
level framework. To make life simple this tutorial will use [Octopress 3]
on top of [Jekyll].

From [Octopress] home page:

> Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis for Jekyll, the
> blog aware static site generator powering Github Pages. To start
> blogging with Jekyll, you have to write your own HTML templates,
> CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration. But with Octopress
> All of that is already taken care of.

**NOTE:** As of December 2014, [Octopress] is at version 2, and
version 3 is being actively developed and documented as a release
candidate. Hopefully by the time you're reading this it will have
been released, well tested and documented.

### Markdown

[Markdown] is a simple plain text based formatting language which is
typically converted into HTML to render on a web page.

By default [Jekyll] and [Octopress 3] use [Markdown] text files to
represent blog posts. Also [GitHub] uses [Markdown] for it's wiki, and
README files, so knowing this will be useful.

Alternatives to [Markdown] such as Kramdown, Textile and others exist
and might be supported by [Jekyll] and [Octopress 3].

For example the following is [Markdown] text:

```
Title
=====

A list of things that are **important**:

* Sandwiches
* Snow
* Books
```

In a browser, using the default [Octopress 3] theme, this would look like:

> <img src="/assets/example-markdown-output.png" alt="Example Output" height="170">

The equivalent generated HTML would be:

```html
<h1 id="title">Title</h1>

<p>A list of things that are <strong>important</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sandwiches</li>
  <li>Snow</li>
  <li>Books</li>
</ul>
```

The general idea is that [Markdown] is easier to read and write, but
you can include HTML if you need more control or something specific
that [Markdown] does not provide.

### Ruby

You may or may not be familiar with [Ruby]. For this tutorial you'll
only need to ensure it's installed and install [Ruby Gems] which is
pretty easy. 

Generally it's worth learning [Ruby] so you can go deeper into
[Jekyll], [Octopress 3] and many other useful tools and applications.

### YAML

[YAML] is a data serialization standard. [Jekyll] and [Octopress 3]
use this in some configuration files. It's also used by many other
tools and applications, so it's worth learning too.

Tutorial
========

Check Ruby Is Installed
-----------------------

Typically [Ruby] is installed on most Unix-like operating systems. As mentioned earlier, this
tutorial uses Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10, but you'll likely have something different.

Let's see if [Ruby] is installed already:

```console
$ type -p ruby
/usr/bin/ruby
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [universal.x86_64-darwin14]
```

If you have [Ruby] version 2.0.0 or later you're probably good to go.

As shown above, on Mac OS X the default version of [Ruby] is
`/usr/bin/ruby`. This is the system version and installing Ruby gems
will require you to be super-user or use `sudo`, which is not
advisable.

The best solution is to install a local up-to-date version of [Ruby],
one good way to do this on Mac OS X is to use [Homebrew] package
manager.

By default Mac OS X does not have [Homebrew], so you may need to
install it. See the [Homebrew Install] page, which on Dec 2014 says:

```console
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

If you already have [Homebrew], you probably know the drill to install ruby:

```console
$ brew update
$ brew install ruby
...
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.2.0p0 (2014-12-25 revision 49005) [x86_64-darwin14]
```

Other operating systems will have different ways to install
ruby. However once that is done, installing [Ruby Gems] is usually the
same across all platforms.

Install Jekyll and Octopress 3
------------------------------

Next install [Jekyll] and [Octopress 3]:

```console
$ gem install octopress --pre
Fetching: fast-stemmer-1.0.2.gem (100%)
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
# lots of similar output for about a minute ...
$ type octopress
octopress is /usr/local/bin/octopress
```

So far so easy. Installing [Octopress 3] automatically installs
[Jekyll] as a dependency. See [Octopress 3] for more details.

**NOTE:** The `--pre` option is required until [Octopress 3] is officially released.

Create Blog Locally
-------------------

Now you can create the bare bones [Octopress] and [Jekyll] directory, which contains the
most basic website and a single example blog post.

For personal [GitHub Pages] the repository on [GitHub] has to be called
`NAME.github.io`, where `NAME` is your account name, so for consistency we
keep the directory and repository name the same. See
[GitHub Pages Help](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics)
for more help.

**NOTE:** Replace `NAME` with your [GitHub] account name.

```console
$ octopress new NAME.github.io
New jekyll site installed in /Users/NAME/Projects/NAME.github.io. 
Octopress scaffold added to /Users/NAME/Projects/NAME.github.io.
```

Preview Blog Locally
--------------------

The previous step created enough data that [Jekyll] can build and view
the equivalent static HTML site.

The command `jekyll serve` will:

* Build the HTML site.
* Start a simple local web server 
* Allow you to locally preview your site in your browser.
* Rebuild the site if any files are modified, so you can watch changes.

```console
$ jekyll serve &
[X] NNNN
Configuration file: /.../NAME.github.io/_config.yml
            Source: /.../NAME.github.io
       Destination: /.../NAME.github.io/_site
      Generating... 
                    done.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/.../NAME.github.io'
Configuration file: /.../NAME.github.io/_config.yml
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

As the command output shows we can open the local web page. Neat trick
is that on Mac OS X the command `open` will do this for us:

```console
$ open http://127.0.0.1:4000/
```

Initialise and Commit To Git Locally
------------------------------------

**NOTE:** Replace `NAME` with your [GitHub] account name.

```console
$ cd NAME.github.io
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /.../NAME.github.io/.git/
$ git branch -m source
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit.'
[master (root-commit) b6f0c3c] Initial commit.
 19 files changed, 820 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 # lots of files ...
```

Notice that the source to the blog should not be the `master` branch,
the example above renames the initial branch to `source`.

With [Octopress 3] as of Dec 2014, the best way to publish to
[GitHub Pages] will be to locally generate the site HTML and push that
to the `master` branch on [GitHub]. Fortunately as we'll see `octopress deploy` to do this.

Therefore locally and on [GitHub] we'll have two (or more branches):

* **source** - The [Octopress 3] and [Jekyll] source files that you edit.
* **master** - The generated HTML site pushed to [GitHub] which is your published blog. 

Perhaps in the future [GitHub] will support [Octopress 3] and you will
be able to just push source, but as it currently stands the [GitHub]
version of [Jekyll] has trouble with plugins (and also you'd probably
have to keep in sync). This is a shame, and somewhat unexpected, but
only makes our life a little harder.

Push Source To GitHub
---------------------

First you'll need create your [GitHub Pages] personal page repository on [GitHub]:

* Login and  to <https://github.com/new> to create a repository.
* Make sure the "Repository name" is `NAME.github.io`, where `NAME` is your "Owner" account name.
* Make it public or private, but note that a private repository still produces a public web page.
* Don't initialise with any files.

Once done you can push the local git repository source up to [GitHub]. Replace
`NAME` with your [GitHub] account name, and `REMOTE` with the name of
the remote used to push to. Good examples might be `origin` or
`github`. Also note that the remote URL assumes you're using ssh
connections to [GitHub].

```console
$ git remote add REMOTE git@github.com:NAME/NAME.github.io.git
$ git push --set-upstream REMOTE source
```

Set Up Deployment Of Website To GitHub
---------------------------------------

So far you have only pushed the `source` branch containing the
[Octopress 3] and [Jekyll] configuration and [Markdown]. [GitHub]
serves your blog from the `master` branch.

Fortunately [Octopress 3] has the `octopress deploy` command which
automates the whole procedure.

* Initialise [Octopress 3] deployment using [git], replacing `NAME` with your account name:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ octopress deploy init git --url git@github.com:NAME/NAME.github.io.git
...
Remember to add _deploy.yml to your .gitignore.
...
```
</div>

* Note that the command suggests you add the generated `_deploy.yml`
  to `.gitignore`. This is probably wise if you need to add passwords
  or other sensitive information.
* Edit `_deploy.yml` to check how [Octopress 3] is configured deploy using [Git].
* By default [Octopress 3] uses the remote named `deploy` to push the website to, so lets set this up:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ git remote add deploy git@github.com:NAME/NAME.github.io.git
```
</div>

* Having the source and published websites as seperate remote names might be useful if one changes in the future.
* Deploy the built website:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ octopress deploy
```
</div>

* For the first deploy to [GitHub], it will take up to 30 minutes to generate your website.
* While you wait, you might want to:
  * Bookmark `http://NAME.github.io/` in your browser, which is where you personal page will reside.
  * Keep refreshing every 5 minutes or so, eventually you should see
    the same thing as your local preview.
  * Read more about [Markdown]
  * Read more about [Octopress 3]
  * Read more about [Jekyll]

In my experience any subsequent deployments of blogs markdown and web
content (assets, html) after this cause the website to update very
quickly (under a minute), but configuration changes to [Jekyll] and
[Octopress 3] seem to take up to half an hour.

Optional: Create a Custom Domain
--------------------------------

You might be happy with hosting your blog at `http://NAME.github.io/`
but typically registering a new domain and setting up DNS redirection
is pretty cheap.

I personally use [Namespro], since they're reasonably priced (about
$60 for two domains over two years), have all the features I wanted
(domain name registration, DNS provider, WHOIS privacy) and local to
me in Vancouver, Canada.

Steps:

* Find a decent registrar and DNS provider you like and get a custom domain name.
* Add a CNAME file to your blog's repository and push to [GitHub].
* Set up a CNAME record with your DNS provider.

See <https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-cname-file-to-your-repository/> for more details.

Personalize The Default Blog
----------------------------

Currently the default blog created by `octopress new` is generic and not personalized with your information. We should certainly fix this now everything seems to be working.

* Fix global configuration. Edit `_config.yml` and change:
  * title - your website title
  * email - your email
  * description - short description (of you and/or your blog) included
    by default at the bottom of all pages and posts.
  * url - your page URL (eg. `http://NAME.github.io/` or your custom domain.
  * twitter_username - your twitter account name if you have one.
  * github_username - your [GitHub] account name.
* Add changes to the repository:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ git add _config.yml
```
</div>

* Fix the "About" text. Edit `about.md` and put some some [Markdown] describing you and/or your blog.

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ git add about.md
```
</div>

* Currently jekyll 2.5.3, changing configuration does not update site. Restart `jekyll serve`, 
  replacing `%1` with the correct job number reported by `jobs`:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 jekyll serve &
$ kill %1
$ jekyll serve &
```
</div>

* Remove the example post:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ git rm _posts/*
```
</div>

* Make sure it looks good on the local preview.
* Push source changes to [GitHub]:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ git commit
$ git push
```
</div>

* Publish website on [GitHub]:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ octopress deploy
```
</div>

Improved Code Blocks
-------------------

The default set up of [Octopress 3] does not include very pretty code blocks, so lets fix that at least.

* First install the [Ruby Gems] you'll need:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ gem install octopress-solarized
$ gem install octopress-codefence
```
</div>

* Then we need to tell [Octopress 3] that you want to use these plugins on your site. Edit the `_config.yaml` file and add the following to the end:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```yaml
gems:
  - octopress-codefence
  - octopress-solarized
```
</div>

* You can configure each plugin also, and with the default theme it is best to use the light "Solarized" theme. Create `_plugins/octopress-solarized/config.yml` with the contents:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```yaml
style: light
```
</div>

* Add this to the repository.

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ git add _plugins
$ git commit
$ git push
```
</div>

* If you have `jekyll serve` running, you should restart it as described previously.

* Now you can write a code block as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">

<pre>
 ```C++
 int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 {
     printf("Hello world\n");
 }
 ```
</pre>

Which will look like this:

```C++
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    printf("Hello world\n");
}
```
</div>

Write Your First Blog
---------------------

* Create a new post, replace `"My First Post"` with the right title:

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
```console
$ octopress new post "My First Post"
```
</div>

* Edit the file `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-my-first-post.markdown`, replacing with the current year, month, date and title.
* Add some [Markdown] to make your first post.
* If you are running `jekyll serve`, save the file and refresh your
  browser and you should see your changes.
* At any time use `git add` and `git commit` to commit local changes to your post or website.
* At any time use `git push` to save your source changes to [GitHub] (this does not publish your website however).
* Once everything looks good to publish use `octopress deploy` to publish your website on [GitHub].
* Repeat this to add more blog posts.

Go Crazy
--------

You might want to do more crazy things later:

* Install more [Jekyll] and [Octopress 3] plugins.
  * Look into [Octopress 3] Ink plugin and themes for a simple way to do this.
  * As of Dec 2014 this part is still under development.
* Add a comment system.
  * **NEW** See [Free Blog Comments]({% post_url 2015-01-31-free-blog-comments %}) for follow up post showing how to do this.
* Find or make your own theme.
* Add a better home page.
* Add other pages, background images, and common headers and footers.
* Look at other people's [Octopress] blogs for inspiration, and check
  their repository sources to see how it's done.
  * See <https://github.com/harveyt/harveyt.github.io> for the source to this blog.

Some of these might be a subject for a future tutorial.
